# üïπÔ∏è Basic‚ÄëGames

This repository contains personal C++ projects developed while working through ***Beginning C++ Through Game Programming***, 4th Edition by Michael‚ÄØDawson. The book teaches programming concepts through progressively richer text‚Äëbased games.

---

## üéØ Purpose

* Reinforce core C++ concepts in a fun, game‚Äëcentered context.
* Practice writing console applications that grow in complexity‚Äîfrom simple loops to class‚Äëbased games.
* Track progress by keeping completed chapter examples and final projects in one place.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

Each folder corresponds to a book chapter and typically includes:

| Folder          | Chapter & Topics                                               |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Chapter1/`     | Basics: data types, variables, I/O (e.g., *Lost Fortune*)      |
| `Chapter2/`     | Control flow: branching, loops, game loop (*Guess My Number*)  |
| `Chapter3/`     | Arrays, strings, loops (*Word Jumble*, *Tic-Tac-Toe*)          |
| `Chapter4/`     | STL: vectors, iterators (*Hangman*)                            |
| ‚Ä¶               | Continuing through functions, classes, pointers, OOP, etc.     |
| `FinalProject/` | Culminating game that ties together all concepts from the book |

*Current Progress is only through Chapter 2*

## üöÄ Running the Games

1. **Install a C++ compiler:**

   * **Windows:** MinGW‚Äëw64 (via MSYS2) or Visual Studio Build Tools
   * **macOS/Linux:** `g++` or `clang++` via your package manager

2. **Open a terminal** in VS‚ÄØCode or your shell and navigate to a chapter folder:

   ```bash
   cd Chapter1
   ```

3. **Compile** the source file:

   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++17 LostFortune.cpp -o LostFortune
   ```

4. **Run** the executable:

   ```bash
   ./LostFortune       # macOS/Linux
   .\LostFortune.exe   # Windows
   ```

Repeat for other source files in each chapter directory.

## üìö About the Book

* **Title:** Beginning C++ Through Game Programming (4th Edition)
* **Author:** Michael‚ÄØDawson
* **Focus:** Teaching C++ fundamentals via console‚Äëbased game development, with a complete project each chapter.

---

## ‚úÖ What‚Äôs Covered

* **Variables** & **data types**
* **Control structures:** `if`, `switch`, loops
* **Functions** & **recursion**
* **Arrays**, **strings**, **vectors** (STL)
* **Pointers**, **references**, **dynamic memory**
* **Object-oriented programming:** classes, inheritance, polymorphism
* **Final integrated game** tying together all learned concepts

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Extending the Projects

* Refactor game logic into reusable **classes** or **modules**.
* Add features like **file I/O**, **save/load** functionality, or **AI opponents**.
* Transition from console to a graphics library such as **SFML** or **SDL**.
* Adopt modern C++ standards (C++17, C++20) and explore new language features.
